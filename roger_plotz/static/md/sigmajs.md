There's a lot yet to do here, but since I've already spent one hour trying to load a `gexf` file with nothing but heartache to show for it... I think I need to move on.

All in all, this is a useful enough library for network visualization. You can see about a million examples of applications on [their github repo](https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/tree/master/examples) as well as in the wild. I'll note that there may be some issues with certain `gexf` file formatting, for example -- why am I able to parse [*their* Les Mis `gexf` file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacomyal/sigmajs.org/master/assets/data/les-miserables.gexf), but not a [`networkx`](https://networkx.github.io/)-created `gexf` file? Very strange.
