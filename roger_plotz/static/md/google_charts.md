All in all, not bad, `google`. Honestly, other libraries (specifically, `plotly`) were better, but google charts is neck and neck (again with `plotly`) for simplest syntax. Although it can be somewhat hard to cast your data in the format they are expecting (from `pandas`, that is -- its actually trivial, but not one of the built-in `to_json` options), the basic way that a plot is made is literally a copy-paste-search-replace. The fact that you can turn a line plot into a bar plot by changing one word is pretty cool.

Being a `google` product, you can imagine that the amount of google maps integration available to you is pretty nutso. I didn't even scratch the surface, opting instead for a `GeoChart` type (more in line with other examples), but the mapping feature is pretty robust.

No 3d rendering is probably a dealbreaker, though.
