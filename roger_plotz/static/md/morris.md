This is a pretty easy charting library, but has some obvious deficiencies. First of all, it (like so many other libraries) assumes we are dealing with temporal data. As you can see in the line chart above, the x axis is assumed to be time for all line plots.

Also, clearly the number of plotting options is a little limited. In addition to the two above, there is also a built-in donut chart type. That is it, though.

All in all, for a library this easy I would definitely use it if my requirements were minimal enough.
