These people seem supremely focused on making `css`-able graphs. To their credit, the demos they have look really, really cool. The animation capabilities they show off are also really pretty swell. I could imagine using transitions / animations / effects to *really* highlight some important point to a client.

Tooltips were... an adventure. They require [a special plugin](https://github.com/Globegitter/chartist-plugin-tooltip) (which is supposed to be `bower`-installed, which lead me to [this handy trick](http://statusq.org/archives/2014/10/25/6161/)). There is additionally a bunch of custom code and css styling used to get the tooltips to work and I never quite got it all the way there. That's why there's a bunch of bower nonsense cluttering up my workspace right now... awesome.

Anyway... all in all, cool library, but not for me. Give me something that looks less cool but works easily and I'm more than happy.

#### Update:
I changed the alpha value in the `css` from 0 to 1. Funny how that makes things visible all of a sudden, no?

In the end, trying to get this library to work well helped me out a lot. I learned a lot about `css` animations, most of which will be transferable. I also think that the library, after I learned how to think with it, is much more flexible and fun than I realized. I could see this being an option for very specific needs.
