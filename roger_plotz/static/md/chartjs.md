Another rollercoaster of emotions.

This library has a lot of potential, and is actually really, really well done (for what it does). That's an emphasis on five (and only five) plot types:

1. line
1. bar
1. radar
1. polar area
1. pie / doughnut

For all of those, it actually makes very slick, responsive graphs. Note that this is the first library (I think?) that I have used so far which is creating HTML5 canvas elements. This may give it a leg up in future development.

That being said, for now I think it's a no-go. The syntax isn't super convenient for `python` (though it's not hard), and it's simply not as obvious as some more full-featured competitors.
