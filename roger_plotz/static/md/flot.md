The default settings look fine, but really there isn't enough here to justify using it over many of the other options. `highcharts`, `google charts`, `chart.js`, and `plotly` are all significantly ahead of this in terms of functionality, and they all look pretty nifty out of the box too.

For what it's worth, zoom capability does exist -- but you have to program your own mouse event handlers, which defeats the purpose in my opinion.
